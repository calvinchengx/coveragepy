    - ELSE:
        - Build and publish docs:
            $ make publish
- Kits:
    - source .tgz and windows .exe for each Python
        - $ allkits.cmd
- Update PyPi:
    - $ make pypi
    - upload the kits:
        - $ allkits.cmd upload
        # note: this seems to try to upload each file twice, so you'll have a
        # successful upload, then a failure, but the file gets there.
    - Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=coverage :
        - show/hide the proper versions.
- Tag the tree
    - hg tag -m "Coverage 3.0.1" coverage-3.0.1
- Update nedbatchelder.com
    - Edit webfaction.htaccess to make sure the proper versions are mapped to /beta
    - Blog post?
- Update bitbucket:
    - Issue tracker should get new version number in picker.
    # Note: don't delete old version numbers: it marks changes on the tickets
    # with that number.
- Announce on coveragepy-announce@googlegroups.com .
- Announce on TIP.
- Ask Christophe Zwerschke (cito@online.de) to build win64 kits.


* Making virtualenvs on Windows

- cd c:\vpy\coverage
- \py32\xx\python ..\virtualenv.py xx
- copy ..\distutils.cfg xx\Lib\distutils
- cd nose_source_directory_someplace
- \vpy\coverage\xx\Scripts\python.exe setup.py install


* Building

- Install fixtar on any Windows Python used to make source kits: http://bitbucket.org/ned/fixtar
- Create PythonXX\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg::
    [build]
    compiler = mingw32

* Testing

(automate these someday)

- On Py 2.x: need setuptools installed
- On Py 3.x: need Distribute installed
- Need nose installed
- Need to have coverage dev-installed
- In each Python installation to be used, create a "coverage_test_egg.pth"
  containing::

    c:\ned\coverage\trunk\test\eggsrc\dist\covtestegg1-0.0.0-py2.5.egg

  (or equivalent).

  These go in c:\python26\lib\site-packages or
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages, for example.

- For complete coverage testing, in each Python installation, create a
  "zzz_coverage_process_start.pth" containing::

    import coverage; coverage.process_startup()

- To run the Javascript tests:

    open test/js/index.html in variety of browsers.
