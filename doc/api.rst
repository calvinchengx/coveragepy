:history: 20090524T134300, brand new docs.
:history: 20090613T164000, final touches for 3.0
:history: 20100221T151500, docs for 3.3 (on the plane back from PyCon)

The API to coverage.py is very simple, contained in a single module called
`coverage`.  Most of the interface is in a single class, also called
`coverage`.  Methods on the coverage object correspond to operations available
in the command line interface. For example, a simple use would be::

    import coverage

    cov = coverage.coverage()
    cov.start()

    # .. run your code ..

    cov.stop()
    cov.save()
